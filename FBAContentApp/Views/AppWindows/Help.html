                        <h2 class="text-center">Program Overview</h2><br /><br />
                        <p>The purpose of this program is to create box content labels that meet Amazon fulfillment centers' <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/202049090">specifications</a> (you'll need to log into Seller Central to view the documentation).</p>
                        <p>
                            The program accepts an Excel workbook (.xlsx extenstion) file as the contents of an entire shipment. Each worksheet in the workbook represents a box.
                            The program goes through each worksheet and creates the appropriate box content string. The program creates a Zebra Programming Language (ZPL) string that is sent to the label printer for printing. (<strong>NOTE:</strong> The printer used must have the capability of interpreting ZPL 2 commands.) All shipment information is saved to a database and labels like the image below are printed.
                        </p>

                        <figure class="figure" style="width: 80%;">
                            <img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="Resources/images/zplLabel.jpg" alt="Card image cap">
                            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
                                Box Content Label produced by this program.
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <br /><br />

                        <p>
                            The program is loaded with a default Company Ship From address, the one in the image above. In order to reflect your company's information, you must add a company address in the <strong>Settings</strong> portion of this application. Furthermore, the label also produces the shipment box label that Amazon provides as well. Therefore, you only need this label and not the ones that are generated in Seller Central. However, feel free to use both.
                        </p>

                        <p>As mentioned previously, when the labels are printed they are also saved to a database. This allows the capability of looking at shipments from the past as well as easily reprinting labels through the <strong>History</strong> portion of this application. The application also saves shipment contents information in a JSON file to the directory specified in the <strong>Settings</strong> portion of the application. This is to provide an easy way of doing more with the data if someone chooses to do so.</p>

                        <p>
                            This application uses Excel workbooks to read box content information for a shipment. Each worksheet in a workbook represents a box. The box number is determined by the Sheet number. We'll go into more detail on how to prepare this file. If you don't have access to an installation of Excel, you can also prepare this in Google Sheets. As we go through this how-to, examples for both Excel and Google Sheets will be presented.

                        <h6>Using Microsoft Excel</h6>
                        <p>Open a new Excel workbook. Save the workbook. When prompted for the file name, name the file the <strong><var>Shipment Id</var></strong> for the shipment. It usually starts with <strong>FBA</strong> and a total of 12 characters long. Save it to your desired directory.</p>

                            Enter each item, even if there's two of the same item. The program will automatically tally-up items with the same identifier.

                            In Google sheets there's a few more steps to complete. You'll need to download the workbook as an Excel file.

                        <p>Now that a workbook has been created for a shipment, this program is ready to process it and print box content labels. Before proceeding, make sure you have a default <strong>Label Printer</strong> selected in <strong>Settings</strong>, as well as a <strong>Company Address</strong>, and a <strong>Save File Directory.</strong> If a <strong>Company Address</strong> for your company is not set, it will use the default one created at the time of install, which just a generic value. If <strong>Label Printer</strong> is not set, you will not be able to print thermal labels. However you'll still be able to <strong>Print to PDF</strong> (<strong>Note</strong>: You will need to be connected to the internet to render a PDF file.). Lastly, if there is not a <strong>Save File Directory</strong> set in the <strong>Settings</strong> of the application, no file will be saved of the contents. However, the shipment will still be saved to the database allowing for reprinting from the <strong>History</strong> section of the application.
                        <p>Now that we have that out of the way, let's process a shipment.</p>

                            From the Main Menu of the application, click on the <strong>Process Shipment</strong> button. This will take you to the shipment processing page. Click the <strong>Add Boxes</strong> button and select the workbok that contains the shipment box contents you wish to process. If it's a large shipment with many boxes, give the program a moment to process the file.

                            Next, select the Amazon Fulfillment Center the shipment is going to. You can find this in Amazon Seller Central. In the Shipping Queue (Seller Central), find your shipment by Shipment ID and look at the column titled "Destination". There will be a four character combination indicating where that shipment is going. That four character combination is in the drop-down menu for selecting an Amazon warehouse. You can also find it by clicking into the shipment from the shipping queue and looking at the "Ship To" address.

                        <p>Once the boxes have been added and an Amazone Warehouse has been selected, you are ready to print. You have two options for printing the labels; directly to a thermal printer, or generate a PDF file. Regardless of which one you click, the shipment details will save in a JSON formatted file to the <strong>Save File Directory</strong> as well as saved to the database. A pop-up box will appear informing you of any errors/success.</p>

                        <p><strong>REMINDER</strong>: If there is no defaul thermal printer set in the <strong>Settings</strong> of the application, nothing will happen if you click <strong>Print Thermal Labels</strong>. You also have the option of creating a PDF file of the thermal labels. However, you must be connected to the internet because the PDF is returned from <a href="http://www.labelary.com/service.html">Labelry.com</a>'s API service.</p>

Doing so is quite self-explanatory. Any changes you make here are automatically saved to the database.

                            In this section of the application, a user can view all of the shipments that are stored in the database. Shipments get stored in the database when a shipment is processed and labels are printed from the <strong>Process Shipments</strong> section of the application. From here you can reprint labels for shipments. You can select one or multiple boxes at a time. You also have the ability to search for a shipment. The search field is case insensitive.
                        </p>
                        <p>By default, the shipments are ordered by date. The most recent shipment is at the top of the first list box. The second list box contains all the boxes belonging to the selected shipment. To the right of the boxes list box is the shipment details.</p><br /><br />

This way the label that's generated will look like the shipping labels Amazon provides.

                        <p>To add a new <strong>Company Ship From</strong> address, simply click the <strong>Add New Ship From</strong> button and fill out the form in the window that pops up.

                            The <strong>Save File Directory</strong> is where all files will be saved. The program generates a few different files. When a shipment is processed, a JSON text file of the shipment details is saved. Another text file is also generated which contains the ZPL2 command. It's produced just in case the user would like to see it for whatever reason.
